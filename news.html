                <p class="article_paragraph">
                    The monitoring and management of traffic structures is an important part of the modern traffic system. Modern and efficient road/rail infrastructure operations require regular monitoring and timely maintenance. By their nature, these are multidisciplinary challenges that require collaboration among different disciplines to develop and implement innovative solutions. In recent years, the development of sensing, the Internet of Things, big data, artificial intelligence, digitalization, visualization, and digital twins have provided novel solutions for the fault detection and diagnosis of existing transportation structures, which has ultimately led to improved management, sustainability, and extended life of such key infrastructure assets. This Special Issue aims to provide a unique platform to publish state-of-the-art methods and applications for monitoring traffic structures. Both original research articles and reviews are welcome.

                    This course consisted of two modules. The first module dealt with the concept of serendipity and how to enhance the chances of serendipitous research discovery. 5 tips are suggested to achieve this: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nurture a prepared mind that can recognize serendipitous opportunities.</li>
                    <li>Pursue multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research projects and interactions.</li>
                    <li>Create opportunities for casual collisions.</li>
                    <li>Embrace Failure and nurture a culture of experimentation.</li>
                    <li>Develop a psychologically safe environment.</li>

                <p class="article_paragraph">
                    The content of the second module was dedicated to identifying research gaps. A research gaps are defined as <em>"problems that have not been addressed or answered in previous studies, books or reports"</em> and are the center of any research, thus, adequately identifying a research gap and performing new work to cover it, leads to the advance of knowledge in a scientific field.

                    and the Main Supervisor, <a href="http://www.vplevris.net/en/" target="_blank"><b>Prof. Vagelis Plevris</b></a>, 
                    of the DTADD project participated

                    Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet). During this event they had the opportunity 
                    to listen to the inspirational presentation of <a href="http://www.robinteigland.com/" target="_blank"><b>Prof. Robin Teigland</b></a> who is a 
                    Professor of Strategy, Management of Digitalization, in the Entrepreneurship and

                <p>The TKD Day presentation and discussion that followed, turned around the topics of 
                    sustainability and digitalization and our role as Faculty members and researchers in this 
                    transformation.  An interesting study case about the ocean as a source and case of 
                    transformative change was presented and the discussion panel debated about how can research 
                    contribute to the ongoing digital transformation in a sustainable way.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, both members of the DTADD project had a good opportunity during this event 
                    to do networking, connect with other members of the Faculty, discuss with them some of the 
                    aspects that this recently started Marie Curie project will entail and also interact in a more 
                    informal way during the traditional <a href="https://www.thesocialguidebook.no/blogs/norwegian-culture/the-julebord" target="_blank"><b>Norwegian Julebord</b></a> 
                    organized by the TKD Faculty for its members.</p>

                <h3 class="article_date">25/11/2022</h3>
                <p class="article_paragraph">The <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101066739" target="_blank"><b>DTADD</b></a> project has officially started on November 1<sup>st</sup>, 2022. Among the different activities involved, the communication 
                    and dissemination of the project itself play a paramount role on its success (and entire work package, WP3, is devoted to this end!). 
                    All dissemination, exploitation and communication activities of this fellowship will be based on relevant EU 
                    <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/3bb7278e-ebf3-11e9-9c4e-01aa75ed71a1" class="article_links">policies/guidelines</a>. 
                    The plan for the dissemination and exploitation activities, including communication activities of the DTADD fellowship has as main target audiences 
                    the academic/scientific community, bridge operation and management practitioners as well as the public at large.                   
                </p>
                <p class="article_paragraph">A key milestone of the DTADD project appears at the end of its first month, when the task of developing the official website 
                    of the project would have to be completed (if you are reading this article on this website, that means that this task has been completed and Deliverable 3.2
                    of the fellowship has been made available!). Besides from communicating and disseminating all the activities of the fellowship in its website, a series
                    of official profiles have also been created in all of the following major social media channels:
