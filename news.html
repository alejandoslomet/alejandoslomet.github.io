                <h2 class="article_title">Call for Abstracts! ECCOMAS 2024 Conference Mini Symposium: MS006 Development and Applications of Computational Methods for Digital Twins </h2>
                <h3 class="article_date">03/10/2023</h3>
                <p class="article_paragraph">
                    Digital twins are virtual representations of physical objects, systems, or processes that allow for real-time monitoring, analysis, and simulation. Essentially, they are digital replicas used to model and optimize the behavior and performance of the physical asset. Regardless of challenges and limitations in their full deployment and implementation in real practice, there seems to be only one school of thought and a consensus toward the future adoption of Digital Twins for design, construction, management, operation, and decommissioning of assets among the scientific community and practitioners. Current research gaps in the practical development and implementation of Digital Twins are mainly related to:
                </p> 
                    
                <ul>
                    <li>Lack of interoperability among the different proprietary and open-source software used along the Digital Twin model generation pipeline.</li>
                    <li>Performance improvement of currently available anomaly detection, location, description, and prognosis algorithms.</li>
                    <li>The direction for the creation of macro-digital twins that integrate Digital Twins of individual assets.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="article_paragraph">
                    Furthermore, future potential developments on this topic are related to the implementation of Industry 5.0 concepts and ideas within Digital Twin frameworks such as sustainability, human-centrism, and resilience. Contributions aiming at tackling any of these issues by means of novel developments and applications of computational methods are welcome to participate in this mini symposium. Either basic methodologies, scientific developments and/or industrial applications are equally accepted.

                    The Digital Twin (DT) concept, as understood nowadays, appeared in the early 2000s as an attempt to create virtual replicas of physical assets, such as bridges, that can be used to examine, monitor and manage their performance. Up to this day, it has been successfully applied in the fields of aeronautics, manufacturing, medicine, and more recently, in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. The DT of a bridge requires the creation of a virtual replica of the real-life asset, along with the connection and feedback of information channel between the two of them. This connection is currently achieved through the generation of real-time data by the placement of sensors in the real bridge and the application of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) techniques to analyze such data. This connection could result in a complex, time-consuming, and expensive process which would hinder the creation of DT prototypes for development purposes in the bridge engineering field.

                <p class="article_paragraph">
                    Although the creation of synthetic benchmark datasets for the validation of novel damage detection approaches has been attempted in the past, such alternatives are not easily findable or accessible. Thus, a synthetic data generation framework that can produce FAIR benchmark databases that are based on Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Re-use, which could be used in the prototyping of bridge DTs was proposed. Moreover, uncertainty types, sources, and quantification approaches involved in the synthetic data generation methodologies and tools of the intended framework were studied.

                    Regardless of the challenges and limitations in the full deployment of Digital Twins and their implementation in real practice, there seems to be only one school of thought and a consensus toward their future adoption for design, construction, management, operation, and decommissioning of bridges among the scientific community and practitioners. Future potential developments on this topic are related to the implementation of Industry 5.0 concepts and ideas within Digital Twin frameworks such as sustainability, human-centrism, and resilience. Contributions of novel developments and applications on these topics are welcome to participate. Papers on theories, methods, algorithms, and applications are all welcome.

                <h3 class="article_date">30/01/2023</h3>
                <p class="article_paragraph">
                    The monitoring and management of traffic structures is an important part of the modern traffic system. Modern and efficient road/rail infrastructure operations require regular monitoring and timely maintenance. By their nature, these are multidisciplinary challenges that require collaboration among different disciplines to develop and implement innovative solutions. In recent years, the development of sensing, the Internet of Things, big data, artificial intelligence, digitalization, visualization, and digital twins have provided novel solutions for the fault detection and diagnosis of existing transportation structures, which has ultimately led to improved management, sustainability, and extended life of such key infrastructure assets. This Special Issue aims to provide a unique platform to publish state-of-the-art methods and applications for monitoring traffic structures. Both original research articles and reviews are welcome.

                    This course consisted of two modules. The first module dealt with the concept of serendipity and how to enhance the chances of serendipitous research discovery. 5 tips are suggested to achieve this: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nurture a prepared mind that can recognize serendipitous opportunities.</li>
                    <li>Pursue multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research projects and interactions.</li>
                    <li>Create opportunities for casual collisions.</li>
                    <li>Embrace Failure and nurture a culture of experimentation.</li>
                    <li>Develop a psychologically safe environment.</li>

                    The content of the second module was dedicated to identifying research gaps. A research gaps are defined as <em>"problems that have not been addressed or answered in previous studies, books or reports"</em> and are the center of any research, thus, adequately identifying a research gap and performing new work to cover it, leads to the advance of knowledge in a scientific field.
