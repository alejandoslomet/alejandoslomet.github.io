                    <h2>Context</h2>
                    <p>In 2018 the Morandi bridge collapsed in Genova, Italy, killing 43 people, forcing the displacement of 200 families
                        living below the bridge, causing damages of EUR 422 million and yearly losses of EUR 784 million to the industry
                        sector in the region. More recently, in April 2020, the Italian bridge over the river Magra collapsed only a few
                        months after being inspected and repaired. After these disasters, several European countries reported the poor state
                        of their aging bridge infrastructure and highlighted the need of urgent investments to guarantee user safety and
                        adequate functioning of their transport networks. Most bridges in Europe were built after 1945, were designed with a 50-
                        100 year design life and have already started to deteriorate. In fact, it is estimated that 10% of those bridges are
                        structurally deficient.</p>
                    <p>From another point of view, many old European bridges are considered to have a cultural heritage value.
                        Seven European bridges have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List thanks to their
                        outstanding universal cultural value. In addition to the human and economic losses, the damage or collapse of a
                        historical bridge also entails the painful loss of a cultural asset.</p>

                    <h2>Problematic</h2>
                    <p>The problem of damage detection in bridge monitoring may seem like a simple classification problem, i.e.
                        identifying whether there is or there is not any damage in the bridge. Several researchers have applied well-known
                        machine learning and classification algorithms to try to identify damage in bridges. Chalouhi <i>et al.</i> implemented a
                        two-stage artificial neural network process for damage detection in railway bridges. Pan <i>et al.</i> implemented
                        a support vector machine to try to identify damage in cable-stayed bridges. More recently, Tran-Ngoc <i>et al.</i> presented
                        a modified artificial neural network cuckoo search algorithm that was tested on a steel truss bridge.</p> 
                    <p>However, the individual and highly
                        complex nature of bridges may result in different dynamic responses and thus add to the complexity of this task.
                        According to Mehrotra <i>et al.</i> these classification approaches are rarely successful due to the important imbalance
                        between normal and anomalous cases, and thus result in too many false negatives. An excessive number of false
                        negatives may hinder the detection of actual damages or substantial decay, ultimately affecting the performance of a
                        bridge and, in critical cases, leading to its collapse. Conversely, a large number of false positives would lead to
                        unnecessary spending of resources. By contrast, an acceptable number of false positives may be even desirable for
                        damage detection on cultural heritage bridges which could be obtained with the application of a fine-tuned anomaly detection
                        algorithm. Moreover, anomaly detection algorithms have been specifically developed to deal with complex damage detection
                        situations and could effectively detect changes in the data collected during a bridge health monitoring process.
                        Furthermore, anomaly detection algorithms can be applied on unsupervised datasets, which makes them highly efficient even if data is not
                        tagged.</p>
                    <p>Because of the large number of existing bridges and the limited availability of human and economic
                        resources, it is not feasible to continuously inspect and assess the structural condition of every bridge in Europe. In
                        the current practice, bridge inspections are performed on a code-prescriptive fixed-scheduled periodic basis varying
                        between two to six years. However, those periodic revisions have proven to be ineffective, as damage could appear
                        after a periodic inspection and not be detected until the next one, leading to further deterioration of the bridge and
                        increased cost of its eventual repair or replacement, if not to its collapse as in the Magra bridge case.</p> 
                    <p>In addition to
                        the particular condition of a bridge, other factors can be considered in scheduling and performing bridge inspections.
                        Most approaches consider the current and future usage of the bridge, its role in the transportation network, as well as
                        other environmental, political and social factors. Unfortunately, proper consideration of the cultural heritage value of a bridge is
                        consistently lacking in the current bridge management methodologies, i.e., Honfi <i>et al.</i>, as most of the current
                        methodologies, do not even consider the heritage value of the bridge in their bridge management methodology. Janas
                        <i>et al.</i> only consider the historical value of the bridge as a subset of three factors implemented to determine bridge
                        repair priority. It is of paramount importance to integrate cultural heritage values with bridge management methodologies, in
                        agreement with international principles of conservation, otherwise irreplaceable parts of our built environment may
                        be lost forever.</p>

                    <h2>Proposed solution</h2>
                    <p>A way to tackle the issue of insufficient resources at network level, while adequately considering the cultural heritage
                        value of a bridge, is to implement a reliability-based bridge management approach. A reliability-based bridge management approach depends on the implementation of a constant bridge
                        monitoring system capable of detecting any significant changes in the structural response of the bridge that may
                        indicate damage or substantial decay. Constant bridge monitoring could become a short-term reality at a network level
                        thanks to the implementation of low-cost internet-of-things-driven systems, such as the one developed by
                        Malik <i>et al.</i> Based on the nature and severity of the detected change, a reliability estimation is performed in order
                        to assess the possible intervention scenarios. The bridge management stakeholder uses the generated information to
                        make an informed decision, thus optimizing the resources it has at its disposal. The main advantage of implementing
                        a reliability-based bridge management approach over code-prescriptive fixed-scheduled periodic inspections is that if the bridge suffers significant damage
                        at any moment in time, immediate action can be taken. Therefore, repairs are applied before damage progresses and
                        becomes more expensive to fix or leads to the failure of the bridge. Moreover, by constantly monitoring the condition
                        of the bridge, scheduled inspections could be postponed if no significant change is detected, thus saving important
                        resources that can be directly applied to inspecting other damaged bridges. Therefore, a RBBMA leads to improved
                        bridge performance and CH conservation, an increase in the bridge service life and to an eventual reduction of the
                        maintenance and operation costs of the bridge network.</p>
                    <p>This interdisciplinary project will go beyond the state of the art by improving bridge damage detection
                        with the application of a high-performance anomaly detection algorithm to the post-processing of the data collected from bridge monitoring.
                        The DTADD is a very ambitious, yet achievable project since for the first time, an automatic algorithm will be
                        implemented with the cultural heritage value of bridges explicitly in mind. The selected anomaly detection algorithm will be fine-tuned to provide an
                        acceptable number of false positives in order to ensure the adequate and timely detection of damages in cultural heritage bridges,
                        thus preventing their irreplaceable loss. Furthermore, a specialized open-source decision-making plug-in with a
                        reliability-based management approach that explicitly considers the cultural heritage of bridges will be developed. This plug-in
                        could be directly integrated within any of the currently implemented bridge maintenance systems in Europe,
                        thus bringing the outcomes of this research directly to the reach of bridge management practitioners and stakeholders.
                        This plug-in will foster the preventive conservation of existing bridges in Europe leading to an improved cultural heritage
                        conservation and to more sustainable management and operation of bridge networks.</p>

                Methodology
            </h1>
            <section class="home_section" id="home_methods">
                <div id="home_methods_text">
                    <h2>Proposed actions</h2>
                    <p>The overall methodology proposed by the DTADD fellowship starts with the
                        construction of a digital twin model of a bridge. A digital twin is a virtual replica of a real-world bridge (asset, process or system).
                        To address R&IO1, and following the guidance provided by Dang and Shim, the 3D geometry of the bridge will
                        be created through a building information modelling approach, whereas that the mechanical twin will be
                        constructed in a finite element software (this BIM-FE approach has proven to be very effective on the
                        construction of digital twins of bridges).</p> 
                    <p>Sensors installed during a bridge health monitoring process can provide data about
                        the environmental conditions, loads and response of the structure to those loads, either at local-element or global bridge
                        scale. An important challenge of this project would be the collection of actual damage/decay scenarios (which
                        may not occur) from a real-life bridge during the duration of the fellowship. Therefore, a series of damage and decay
                        scenarios will be simulated directly on the digital twin model, which will reproduce the structural response of its physical
                        counterpart through a series of finite element models. This novel digital approach will allow testing the bridge and generate the
                        required data under several "normal" and "damaged/decayed" scenarios which may otherwise not occur during the
                        duration of the fellowship if the data were to be collected from a real bridge in real time. Both supervised and
                        unsupervised databases will be generated with the data obtained from the digital twin simulations.</p> 
                    <p>The way in which artificial intelligence will
                        be used during the fellowship consists on testing three different types of anomaly detection algorithms to analyze the data gathered through
                        the bridge digital twin simulations, namely: distance-based, density-based and rank-based algorithms. The algorithms
                        performance in detecting damage, in terms of the dynamic structural response of the bridge and the local response of
                        some key structural elements, will be assessed based on precision, recall and rank power parameters. Moreover, the
                        data obtained from the digital twin simulations will be analyzed by the anomaly detection algorithms based on the classification of the bridge, i.e. cultural heritage
                        bridge vs non-cultural heritage bridge. The anomaly detection algorithm will be finely tuned to accept a certain number of false positives when
                        determining whether there is any damage in the bridge. If no damage is detected and no inspection was previously
                        scheduled, then the process ends. If, on the other hand, an inspection is scheduled, the process jumps to the
                        prioritization/optimization module, where the possibility of re-assigning the previously intended resources for such
                        inspection elsewhere is evaluated.</p> 
                    <p>If the algorithm detects damage in the bridge, a reliability-based bridge management approach module is run to
                        determine its reliability, followed by the prioritization/optimization module where inspection needs and scopes are
                        defined. After an inspection is performed, and based again on the bridge classification, an intervention strategy will
                        be proposed, prioritizing maintenance and repair for a cultural heritage bridge or the optimization of resources for a conventional
                        bridge.</p> 
                    <p>To address R&IO2, the proposed methodology involves the development of a multi-criteria
                        prioritization/optimization algorithm that includes a novel cultural heritage constraint. This constraint will assign more weight to
                        the maintenance/repair intervention in case where the bridge management system is dealing with a cultural heritage bridge. This relatively simple but
                        crucial modification will decisively influence the generation of what-if scenarios, thus increasing the stakeholder
                        awareness of the importance of cultural heritage conservation.</p> 
                    <p>Both the anomaly detection algorithm implementation and the multi-criteria
                        prioritization/optimization modules will be developed under strict interoperability standards. The ultimate goal is to
                        achieve an optimal compatibility with the current bridge management systems operated in Europe and maximize the impact of these
                        fellowship results on the different stakeholders involved in the decision-making process of management and
                        operation of the existing bridge infrastructure in Europe.</p>

                    <h2>Interdisciplinarity</h2>
                    <p>The DTADD fellowship follows an interdisciplinary approach, combining knowledge and expertise from
                        the disciplines of bridge and structural engineering, artificial intelligence, reliability analysis and assets
                        management, and cultural heritage conservation. Bridge and structural engineering knowledge are of paramount importance in
                        order to understand the behavior of bridges and their response to applied loads. Finite element models are used
                        in these fields to represent a real system, simulate its structural behavior and assess its safety level. During this
                        fellowship a digital twin model with a mechanical finite element component of a bridge prototype will be created and it will serve the
                        purpose of generating the necessary data to represent scenarios of damage/decay on real life bridge. A paramount
                        component of the DTADD proposal is the assessment and implementation of anomaly detection algorithms, which were originally developed
                        and implemented in the discipline of artificial intelligence, for the improvement of damage detection on bridges. Concepts and expertise
                        on reliability analysis and asset management will guide the development of the multi-criteria
                        prioritization/optimization algorithm with a novel cultural heritage constraint. This algorithm will explicitly consider the cultural heritage value
                        of existing bridges. Finally, knowledge in this field of cultural heritage conservation is required to be aware of the importance
                        that cultural heritage plays in Europe, the accepted conservation philosophies and the main methodologies that could be applied
                        in order to foster the development and improvement of cultural heritage bridges.</p>

                    <h2>Gender issues</h2>
                    <p>The proposal evaluates gender and diversity aspects through a set of key questions suggested by the Gendered
                        Innovations' Engineering Checklist. There are no gender or diversity issues directly related to the proposal
                        objectives, methodology or simulations, nor to the utilization of the proposal outcomes by different sex and genders.
                        The project will adhere to OsloMet gender policy as described in the Gender Equality Plan and be adjusted as
                        appropriate if any gender or diversity aspects are discovered during the project period.</p>

                    <h2>Open science</h2>
                    <p>The DTADD fellowship fully complies with the mandatory open science practices, and would apply as
                        often as possible the recommended practices, established in the Horizon Europe Programme Guide and in Article 17 of the Model
                        Grant Agreement. The fellowship outputs will be early and openly shared by pre-registering at an early stage of the
                        project a detailed description of the hypothesis, study design and planned analysis at the OSF website and by sharing
                        the preprints of all scientific publications generated at the Preprints platform. The immediate open access to the
                        scientific publications produced will be guaranteed by selecting relevant journals compatible with Horizon Europe open access
                        policies and by using CC BY right of reuse. Alternatively, if a particular article does not fit into the scope of any relevant
                        open access journal, it will be published at the Open Research Europe website under an open peer-review scheme.
                        Moreover, digital access will be granted, and persistent identifiers will be generated, to all software and digital twin
                        models developed as they will be hosted at Github and databases created will be published and shared at Zenodo.
                        Finally, the final fellowship report will contain complementary information about the research outputs/tools
                        needed to validate the conclusions of scientific publications created during the fellowship.</p>
                    <p>Relevant knowledge actors and end-users will be involved in the research project at an early
                        stage during a co-design workshop to discuss the benefits and the challenges of the R&IO of the fellowship, at an
                        intermediate stage during a second co-creation workshop to participate in the developing of an adequate and effective
                        implementation of the proposed tools and finally, at the end of the project during a co-assessment activities workshop
                        in order to test the implemented tool and provide feedback with regards to further improvement steps of the DTADD
                        developed tools.</p>
                    <p>All data and research outputs generated through the DTADD fellowship will be properly managed by a
                        data management plan, as part of the project management plan, and will comply with the FAIR
                        principles. A data management plan will be created at the beginning of the fellowship and published at the DMPOnline platform.
                        The data management plan will be revised biannually and adjusted as required during the duration of the fellowship. The findability,
                        accessibility, interoperability and reusability of the DTADD fellowship generated data will be ensured by applying
                        and complying with the FAIR principles published by Wilkinson <i>et al.</i> and by following the specification and
                        guidelines published by the Research Data Alliance.</p>
