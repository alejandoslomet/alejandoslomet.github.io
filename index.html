                    <h2>Context</h2>
                    <p>In 2018 the Morandi bridge collapsed in Genova, Italy, killing 43 people, forcing the displacement of 200 families
                        living below the bridge, causing damages of EUR 422 million and yearly losses of EUR 784 million to the industry
                        sector in the region. More recently, in April 2020, the Italian bridge over the river Magra collapsed only a few
                        months after being inspected and repaired. After these disasters, several European countries reported the poor state
                        of their aging bridge infrastructure and highlighted the need of urgent investments to guarantee user safety and
                        adequate functioning of their transport networks. Most bridges in Europe were built after 1945, were designed with a 50-
                        100 year design life and have already started to deteriorate. In fact, it is estimated that 10% of those bridges are
                        structurally deficient.</p>
                    <p>From another point of view, many old European bridges are considered to have a cultural heritage value.
                        Seven European bridges have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List thanks to their
                        outstanding universal cultural value. In addition to the human and economic losses, the damage or collapse of a
                        historical bridge also entails the painful loss of a cultural asset.</p>

                    <h2>Problematic</h2>
                    <p>The problem of damage detection in bridge monitoring may seem like a simple classification problem, i.e.
                        identifying whether there is or there isn’t any damage in the bridge. Several researchers have applied well-known
                        machine learning and classification algorithms to try to identify damage in bridges. Chalouhi et al.7 implemented a
                        two-stage artificial neural network (ANN) process for damage detection in railway bridges. Pan et al.8 implemented
                        a support vector machine to try to identify damage in cable-stayed bridges. More recently, Tran-Ngoc et al.9 presented
                        a modified ANN cuckoo search algorithm that was tested on a steel truss bridge. However, the individual and highly
                        complex nature of bridges may result in different dynamic responses and thus add to the complexity of this task.
                        According to Mehrotra et al.10 these classification approaches are rarely successful due to the important imbalance
                        between normal and anomalous cases, and thus result in too many false negatives. An excessive number of false
                        negatives may hinder the detection of actual damages or substantial decay, ultimately affecting the performance of a
                        bridge and, in critical cases, leading to its collapse. Conversely, a large number of false positives would lead to
                        unnecessary spending of resources. By contrast, an acceptable number of false positives may be even desirable for
                        damage detection on CH bridges which could be obtained with the application of a fine-tuned anomaly detection
                        algorithm (ADA). Moreover, ADAs have been specifically developed to deal with complex damage detection
                        situations and could effectively detect changes in the data collected during a bridge health monitoring process.
                        Furthermore, ADAs can be applied on unsupervised datasets, which makes them highly efficient even if data is not
                        tagged.</p>
                    <p>Because of the large number of existing bridges and the limited availability of human and economic
                        resources11, it is not feasible to continuously inspect and assess the structural condition of every bridge in Europe. In
                        the current practice, bridge inspections are performed on a code-prescriptive fixed-scheduled periodic basis varying
                        between two to six years.12 However, those periodic revisions have proven to be ineffective, as damage could appear
                        after a periodic inspection and not be detected until the next one, leading to further deterioration of the bridge and
                        increased cost of its eventual repair or replacement, if not to its collapse as in the Magra bridge case. In addition to
                        the particular condition of a bridge, other factors can be considered in scheduling and performing bridge inspections.
                        Most approaches consider the current and future usage of the bridge, its role in the transportation network, as well as
                        other environmental, political and social factors. Unfortunately, proper consideration of the CH value of a bridge is
                        consistently lacking in the current bridge management methodologies, i.e., Honfi et al13., as most of the current
                        methodologies, do not even consider the heritage value of the bridge in their bridge management methodology. Janas
                        et al14. only consider the historical value of the bridge as a subset of three factors implemented to determine bridge
                        repair priority. It is of paramount importance to integrate CH values with bridge management methodologies, in
                        agreement with international principles of conservation15, otherwise irreplaceable parts of our built environment may
                        be lost forever.</p>

                    <h2>Proposed solution</h2>
                    <p>A way to tackle the issue of insufficient resources at network level, while adequately considering the CH
                        value of a bridge, is to implement a RBBMA. A RBBMA depends on the implementation of a constant bridge
                        monitoring system capable of detecting any significant changes in the structural response of the bridge that may
                        indicate damage or substantial decay. Constant bridge monitoring could become a short-term reality at a networklevel
                        thanks to the implementation of low-cost Internet-of-Things-driven systems, such as the one developed by
                        Malik et al.16 Based on the nature and severity of the detected change, a reliability estimation is performed in order
                        to assess the possible intervention scenarios. The bridge management stakeholder uses the generated information to
                        make an informed decision, thus optimising the resources it has at its disposal. The main advantage of implementing
                        a RBBMA over code-prescriptive fixed-scheduled periodic inspections is that if the bridge suffers significant damage
                        at any moment in time, immediate action can be taken. Therefore, repairs are applied before damage progresses and
                        becomes more expensive to fix or leads to the failure of the bridge. Moreover, by constantly monitoring the condition
                        of the bridge, scheduled inspections could be postponed if no significant change is detected, thus saving important
                        resources that can be directly applied to inspecting other damaged bridges. Therefore, a RBBMA leads to improved
                        bridge performance and CH conservation, an increase in the bridge service life and to an eventual reduction of the
                        maintenance and operation costs of the bridge network.</p>
                    <p>This interdisciplinary project will go beyond the state of the art by improving bridge damage detection
                        with the application of a high-performance ADA to the post-processing of the data collected from bridge monitoring.
                        The DTADD is a very ambitious, yet achievable project since for the first time, an automatic algorithm will be
                        implemented with the CH value of bridges explicitly in mind. The selected ADA will be fine-tuned to provide an
                        acceptable number of false positives in order to ensure the adequate and timely detection of damages in CH bridges,
                        thus preventing their irreplaceable loss. Furthermore, a specialised open-source decision-making plug-in with a
                        reliability-based management approach that explicitly considers the CH of bridges will be developed. This plug-in
                        could be directly integrated within any of the currently implemented bridge maintenance systems (BMS) in Europe,
                        thus bringing the outcomes of this research directly to the reach of bridge management practitioners and stakeholders.
                        This plug-in will foster the preventive conservation of existing bridges in Europe leading to an improved CH
                        conservation and to more sustainable management and operation of bridge networks.</p>
